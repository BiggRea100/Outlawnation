The DMP, which replaces a 2009 sanctuary management plan, addresses current and emerging threats in CINMS and reflects changes in new science and technologies, how people use the sanctuary, and community needs. The DMP supports continued protection of sanctuary resources through enforcement of existing sanctuary regulations, education and outreach strategies that promote ocean stewardship, and community- inclusive involvement. Consistent with the information provided in the 2019 Notice of Intent, NOAA is not proposing modifications to the sanctuary regulations at this time, but may consider regulatory changes in the future. NOAA also prepared a draft environmental assessment (DEA), which evaluates the environmental impacts of implementing the DMP, ongoing field activities, and the existing sanctuary regulations. NOAA is soliciting public comments on the DMP and DEA at this time.</description> <pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate> <guid>https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/12/17/2021-27315/notice-of-availability-of-a-draft-management-plan-and-draft-environmental-assessment-for-the-channel</guid> <dc:creator>Commerce Department, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</dc:creator> </item> <item> <title>Agency Information Collection Activities; Submission to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for Review and Approval; Comment Request; Submission of Conservation Efforts To Make Listings Unnecessary Under the Endangered Species Act</title> <link>https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/12/17/2021-27387/agency-information-collection-activities-submission-to-the-office-of-management-and-budget-omb-for</link> <description></description> <pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate> <guid>https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/12/17/2021-27387/agency-information-collection-activities-submission-to-the-office-of-management-and-budget-omb-for</guid> <dc:creator>Commerce Department, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</dc:creator> </item> <item> <title>Agency Information Collection Activities; Submission to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for Review and Approval; Comment Request; Annual Economic Survey of Federal Gulf and South Atlantic Shrimp Permit Holders</title> <link>https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/12/17/2021-27401/agency-information-collection-activities-submission-to-the-office-of-management-and-budget-omb-for</link> <description>The Department of Commerce, in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), invites the general public and other Federal agencies to comment on proposed, and continuing information collections, which helps us assess the impact of our information collection requirements and minimize the public&amp;#39;s reporting burden.

This AD was prompted by reports of in-flight engine shutdowns (IFESs); investigation results indicated that this could be caused by high altitude climbs at higher thrust settings on engines with certain thrust ratings. This AD requires amending the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to incorporate a new limitation and revise certain normal procedures, as specified in a Transport Canada Civil Aviation (TCCA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.</description> <pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate> <guid>https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/12/17/2021-27319/airworthiness-directives-airbus-canada-limited-partnership-type-certificate-previously-held-by-c</guid> <dc:creator>Transportation Department, Federal Aviation Administration</dc:creator> <category>Air transportation</category> <category>Aircraft</category> <category>Aviation safety</category> <category>Incorporation by reference</category> <category>Safety</category> </item> <item> <title>Addition of Certain Entities to the Entity List and Revision of an Entry on the Entity List</title> <link>https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/12/17/2021-27406/addition-of-certain-entities-to-the-entity-list-and-revision-of-an-entry-on-the-entity-list</link> <description>This final rule amends the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) by adding thirty-seven entities under forty entries to the Entity List.

This proposed AD was prompted by a report that in the event of a specific discrete wire failure, the landing gear extension and retraction system (LGERS) may not be able to complete landing gear retraction when commanded by moving the landing gear lever to the UP position. This proposed AD would require revising the operator&amp;#39;s existing FAA-approved minimum equipment list (MEL) for the landing gear extension and retraction system, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference.

This proposed AD was prompted by a determination that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations related to pylon maintenance are necessary. This proposed AD would require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations for pylon maintenance, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.</description> <pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate> <guid>https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/12/17/2021-27286/airworthiness-directives-airbus-sas-airplanes</guid> <dc:creator>Transportation Department, Federal Aviation Administration</dc:creator> <category>Air transportation</category> <category>Aircraft</category> <category>Aviation safety</category> <category>Incorporation by reference</category> <category>Safety</category> </item> <item> <title>Airworthiness Directives; De Havilland Aircraft of Canada Limited (Type Certificate Previously Held by Bombardier, Inc.)

This proposed AD was prompted by reports of bleed air leaks in the wing box area and failure of the leak detection shroud. This proposed AD would require removing and inspecting the affected V-band coupling and check valve seals, doing corrective actions if necessary, and replacing the coupling and seals with a redesigned assembly. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.</description> <pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate> <guid>https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/12/17/2021-27295/airworthiness-directives-de-havilland-aircraft-of-canada-limited-type-certificate-previously-held-by</guid> <dc:creator>Transportation Department, Federal Aviation Administration</dc:creator> <category>Air transportation</category> <category>Aircraft</category> <category>Aviation safety</category> <category>Incorporation by reference</category> <category>Safety</category> </item> <item> <title>Proposed Amendment of Class D, Class E, and Establishment of Class E Airspace; Atlanta, GA Area</title> <link>https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/12/17/2021-27210/proposed-amendment-of-class-d-class-e-and-establishment-of-class-e-airspace-atlanta-ga-area</link> <description>This action proposes to amend Class D airspace, Class E surface airspace, Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface, and establish Class E Airspace Designated as an Extension to a Class D Surface Area in the Atlanta, GA area.

This action would update several airport names and geographic coordinates. This action would also make an editorial change replacing the term Airport/Facility Directory with the term Chart Supplement in the legal descriptions of associated Class D and E airspace.

Furthermore, DOE proposes to adopt industry provisions related to the prescribed test conditions to further ensure the comparability of test. In addition, DOE proposes to update certain testing instructions to reduce manufacturer burden. Further, DOE proposes to amend the provisions pertaining to certification testing and determination of represented values for electric motors other than dedicated-purpose pool pump motors, apply these provisions to the additional electric motors proposed for inclusion in the scope of the test procedure, and to move both provisions consistent with the location of other certification requirements for other covered products and equipment. Finally, DOE proposes to add provisions pertaining to certification testing and determination of represented values for dedicated-purpose pool pump motors. DOE is seeking comment from interested parties on the proposal.</description> <pubDat
